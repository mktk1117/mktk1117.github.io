I'm Takahiro Miki, a Ph.D. Student at Robotic Systems Lab, ETH Zurich.  
I am interested in robotics, specifically, operating in a challenging environment where a human cannot go, such as hazardous areas or other planet surfaces.  
My current research topic is integrating perception into the quadrupedal robot's locomotion control using reinforcement learning.
